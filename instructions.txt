<main id='divmain'>

In our structure we have a divmain to configure all page, and we need to use <p> tag to organize everything, firstly we can include our information and work togheter in CSS file.

Use tags such as <p> or <div>, after we will work together in our css file than present our project, don't lost several time with a elaborate text in your page, that's just to populate our project.
