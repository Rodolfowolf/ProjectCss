            <p>If there’s any place you should go to for a new vehicle purchase, it’s CA Autosale. Farhan was the best salesperson I could ask for. He helped me find exactly the car I wanted for the best price I saw on the market. Even went the extra mile and delivered it to me. Overall super friendly & knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend.</p>

            <p>My go to for all my vehicles from now on. These guys are straight forward and always listen to what I have to say and will come up with an option that benefits ME first. They make sure you feel appreciated the moment you walk in. I dealt with a great gentleman by the name of Farhan. He helped me from the first call. Invited me in. Helped me choose the perfect vehicle and I’ll be picking it up this week! Would definitely recommend to all my family and friends.</p>

            <p>VUsually going to a dealer is like going to a dentist but more painful. We happened along Mike by chance and it was and still is a stroke of luck. The selection of cars is pretty good. Mike wasn't pushy at all and he let us take our time with multiple visits. He was very patient as we changed our choices of cars a couple of times. We never once felt intimidated. I think we bought from Stallion Auto mainly because of Mike. We are very happy happy with our car and the extra care/attention that we were given.</p>

            <p>It was a very awesome and simple process with this auto company. As a newbie to Canada, they assisted me from the beginning to the end, made sure I was happy and looked out for me. I highly recommend CA AUTO. Thanks Andrew, thanks Mark it was truly a pleasure.</p>
